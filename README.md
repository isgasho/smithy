> Smithy is a front-end framework for Rust

## What is Smithy?

Smithy is a framework for writing WebAssembly applications entirely in Rust. Its goal is to allow you to do so using idiomatic Rust, without giving up any of the compiler's safety guarantees.

You can see an example site, written entirely in Rust, at: https://smithy-todolist.robertbalicki.com. You can see the source code here: https://github.com/rbalicki2/smithy_todolist

Please also see [this README](https://github.com/rbalicki2/smithy-app-server) to learn how to build and deploy your first Smithy site!
